# Reading Assessment

This is a show-text, voice recording, save scores, ask questions about the text, student evaluation, show statistics plugin for Wordpress.

It uses the JS library WaveSurfer and it's plugin Regions to visualize and trim browser recorded soundfiles before upload to server with an ID to go with it.

Why the name? I like words with ass in them, haha! And no, that is not politically correct.

You install this plugin the usual way via the WP installer page.

## Take care
The Internetz can be a nasty place. This plugin saves large sound files. You have to manually allow only a select few: your members, students, teachers and so on, to upload soundfiles. The plugin was made for my own project which is to collect sound recordings from students with various reading skills.
